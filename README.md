 Tkinter file maker

I aws working on learning tkinter but this thing is getting on my last nerve where in order to do the next part I need 
to create a new python file every new lesson I need to do the same thing over and over importing ttk and tk setting up the bog standard
window so yea imma make a quick preloader so I never have to do this again

not sure if I should do this by creating strings for the user to removve or IF i can actually write to python files with
code which would be awesome  either i need this done as this video is 18 bludclart hours long and I can't keep doing
this repetitive action again

it should flow like this
main menu
create new (importing the required folders) or import
use while loop to ask user what they want to add while also letting them add attributes like master 
save (put window.mainloop) then (choose directory to save to)
ask if they want to save loadout


next 
option for the user to import files and use it as a base or to carry on working with it

a builder that can take lines in a set formot and turn them into strings to add to the resulting file like 
label,window (file contents) = (resulting string) label = """Label(window) \n label.pack() """ 

option to add bulk widgets
